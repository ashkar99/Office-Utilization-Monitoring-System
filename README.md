# Office Utilization Monitoring System

## Abstract

The "Office Utilization Monitoring System" is an IoT-driven project designed to enhance office space efficiency. Utilizing entry-point sensors, it accurately counts and records the number of individuals present and their duration of stay in real-time. This system provides essential data, aiding in the optimization and effective management of office premises.


## Description and Background of Idea

The “Office Utilization Monitoring System” is an IoT project that focuses on measuring office space utilization to provide data for decision-making related to optimizing the use of premises. The central aspect of the project involves counting the number of individuals present in an office and the duration of their stay. This is achieved through the deployment of sensors placed at entries. The exterior sensor increments the count if a person enters the place, and the interior sensor decreases the count if a person exits the place. The duration of space usage is recorded as long as at least one person is in the office.
